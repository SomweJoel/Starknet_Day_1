# Starknet_Day_1
## Level 1
#### - What is Cairo designed for?
Cairo is starknet's core programming language designed to provide developers with the best tools for validity proofs STARKs technology.
Its processor is unique because it is unbounded by the limitations of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
#### - How does Cairo's virtual CPU handle cryptographic constraints?
 By using a system called Provable Computation. This approach allows programs to prove their correct execution without needing to be re-run 
## Level 2
#### - What is Starknet?
Starknet is a permissionless network that leverages the power of Stark for scalability, privacy, and security as a Layer-2 scalability solution for ethereum.
#### - How does Starknet function?
It functions as a zero-knowledge Rollup that uses cryptographic systems called STARKs for security and reduced costs.
## Level 3
#### - What is Starkware?
Starkware is a technology company in that focuses on developing and deploying zk-STARK technology.
Starkware’s first key innovation was StarkEx, which, based on a Software as a Service (SaaS) business model, has become one of the most significant Layer 2 solutions in production on Ethereum.
Starkware’s second significant contribution to the blockchain industry is Cairo, a programming language optimized for writing efficient STARK proofs, enabling scalable computation for decentralized applications.
#### - How does StarkEx leverage STARK proofs?
By ensuring the validity of large batches of transactions processed off-chain with a minimal on-chain footprint.
